## üì• Installation Guide  
Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** and **pip** installed.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
Clone the repository to your local machine:  
`git clone https://github.com/mohanganesh3/HEALTHAPP.git`  
`cd HEALTHAPP`  

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment  
It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:  
`python3 -m venv venv`  
`source venv/bin/activate`  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`  

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies  
Install the necessary Python libraries by running:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables  
Make sure to set up the required **Google API key** for **Gemini**. You can add it to a `.env` file in the root of your project:  
`GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>`  

### Step 5: Run the Application  
Start the application using **Streamlit**:  
`streamlit run app.py`  
This will open the app in your default browser. You can upload an image of food and get the total calorie count.

## üí° Usage  
1. **Upload Image**: Choose a food image in JPEG, PNG, or JPG format.  
2. **Enter Prompt**: Input a brief description or question about the food items.  
3. **Get Calorie Information**: Click the button to calculate total calories and receive detailed breakdowns of each food item.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
1. **Image Processing**: The system reads the uploaded food image.  
2. **Food Item Identification**: Using **Gemini**, the image is analyzed to identify food items.  
3. **Calorie Counting**: The AI calculates the total calories and provides a detailed list of items and their individual calorie count.  
4. **User Interaction**: The user inputs the prompt and receives the result directly in the app.

## üìù Example  
### Sample Interaction:  
1. **Upload Image**: Upload an image of a plate with food.
